<h1>Mastercard: Design Phishing Simulation for Employee Training</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project from Mastercard demonstrates editing a phishing email to make it seem more believable to the average person, and develop a realistic scenario for employees to recognize phishing attempts. From this simulation, I analyzed which departments were more likely to fall victim to the phishing attack. I interpreted the results from the data and developed a training presentation to increase employee's security awareness, in order to prevent future security risk. 

<h2>Goals</h2>


- <b> Develop Realistic Phishing Scenarios</b>
- <b> Interpet User Response Data</b>
- <b> Deliver Interactive Education</b>
- <b> Increase Security Awareness for Employees</b>
- <b> Reduce Security Risk</b>

<h2>Summary</h2>
This Mastercard project showcases a phishing simulation designed to create realistic phishing scenarios and test employees' ability to recognize them. By analyzing departmental responses, we identified areas with higher vulnerability to phishing attempts. Based on the results, we developed a targeted training presentation to strengthen employees' security awareness and reduce future risk. This project aims to improve organizational security through data-driven insights and tailored awareness training.
